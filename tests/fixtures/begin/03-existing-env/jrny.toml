[table]

# Specifies which schema and table `jrny` will use to track revision history.
#
# These can freely be changed for new projects. To update these for existing projects
# with revisions already executed, you would need to first manually create the new table
# and then copy all existing revision records from the old table into the new one prior
# to running any commands with `jrny`. Otherwise, `jrny` will attempt to run all again.
